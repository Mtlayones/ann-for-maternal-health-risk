This is the repository of artificial neural network using the dataset of maternal health risk as the final requirement of certain course subject.

### Directory Structure

1. code.ipynb - the source code for the ANN model which is implemented in Jupyter Notebook
2. initial_weights.csv - the weights used in hidden layers and output layer of ANN model
3. maternal_health_risk_data_set.csv - dataset used for the ANN model which is all about the maternal health risk
